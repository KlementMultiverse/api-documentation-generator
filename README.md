> **Analyze production logs in seconds, not hours. AI finds root causes automatically.**

Built for DevOps engineers, SREs, and developers who need to debug production issues fast. This tool analyzes log files, detects patterns, and uses AI to identify root causes - just like the tools used at Netflix, Uber, and Google.

---

## 🎯 **The Problem This Solves**

### Before (Traditional Way):
```
🔴 Production is down
⏰ Engineers spend 2-4 hours:
  → grep through gigabytes of logs
  → Search for error patterns manually
  → Try to correlate timestamps
  → Miss important context
  → Guess at root causes
💰 Downtime cost: $5,000-$50,000/hour
```

### After (With This Tool):
```
🚀 Production is down
✅ Run: python analyzer.py analyze logs/production.log
⏱️  30 seconds later:
  → AI identifies 3 critical errors
  → Shows timeline visualization
  → Pinpoints root cause
  → Suggests fixes
💰 Downtime reduced by 80%
```

## ⚡ **Quick Start (Beginner-Friendly)**

### **Option 1: One-Command Docker (Easiest)**
```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/KlementMultiverse/api-documentation-generator.git
cd api-documentation-generator

# Run with Docker (automatically installs everything)
make docker-run

# Analyze your first log file
docker exec -it log-analyzer python analyzer.py analyze sample_logs/error.log
```

### **Option 2: Local Install (For Development)**
```bash
# Install dependencies
make install

# Set up your AI API key (free tier available)
export NVIDIA_API_KEY="nvapi-YOUR-KEY-HERE"

# Analyze logs
python analyzer.py analyze logs/your-app.log
```

### **Try the Demo (No Installation)**
```bash
# Use our sample logs to see it in action
python analyzer.py demo
```

---

## 🌟 **Real-World Use Cases**

### **1. For Beginners: Debug Your First Production Error**
```bash
# You deployed your app, but users report errors
# Export your app logs to a file
python analyzer.py analyze myapp.log

# Output:
# ✅ Found 15 errors
# 🔍 Root Cause: Database connection timeout
# 💡 Fix: Increase connection pool size in config
# 📊 Timeline: Shows exactly when it started failing
```

### **2. For Startups: Find Why Your API is Slow**
```bash
# Users complain about slow responses
python analyzer.py performance logs/api.log

# Output:
# 🐌 Detected: 50% of requests take >5 seconds
# 🔍 Root Cause: N+1 database queries in /api/users endpoint
# 💡 Suggestion: Add database indexing on user_id column
```

### **3. For SRE Teams: Post-Incident Analysis**
```bash
# After production incident, understand what happened
python analyzer.py timeline logs/incident-2024-01-15.log

# Output:
# 📊 Interactive timeline showing:
#    14:23:15 - First error appears
#    14:23:45 - Error cascade begins
#    14:24:00 - Service goes down
# 🔍 AI Analysis: Memory leak in auth service
```

### **4. For DevOps: Multi-Service Debugging**
```bash
# Microservices failing, need to find which one caused it
python analyzer.py multi-service logs/api.log logs/database.log logs/cache.log

# Output:
# 🎯 Root Cause: Cache service (redis) ran out of memory
# 📉 Cascade: API → Database → All services affected
# 💡 Fix: Increase Redis memory limit in kubernetes config
```

## 📚 **Complete Tutorial**

### **Tutorial 1: Analyze Your First Error Log**

Let's say you have this error in production:

```python
# Your Python app logs:
2024-01-15 14:23:15 ERROR: Connection refused to database at db.example.com:5432
2024-01-15 14:23:16 ERROR: Failed to fetch user data
2024-01-15 14:23:17 ERROR: API request failed with 500
```

**Step 1:** Save logs to a file (`myapp.log`)

**Step 2:** Run the analyzer
```bash
python analyzer.py analyze myapp.log --output report.md
```

**Step 3:** Read the AI-generated report
```markdown
# 🔍 Log Analysis Report

## Summary
- **Total Errors:** 3
- **Time Range:** 14:23:15 - 14:23:17 (2 seconds)
- **Severity:** CRITICAL

## Root Cause
Database connection failure at `db.example.com:5432`

## Analysis
The initial connection failure triggered a cascade:
1. Database refuses connection (network/auth issue)
2. User data fetch fails (depends on DB)
3. API returns 500 (missing user data)

## Recommended Fixes
1. Check database connectivity: `telnet db.example.com 5432`
2. Verify database credentials in environment variables
3. Add connection retry logic with exponential backoff
4. Implement circuit breaker pattern

## Prevention
- Add database health checks
- Set up monitoring alerts for DB connection failures
- Implement graceful degradation
```
